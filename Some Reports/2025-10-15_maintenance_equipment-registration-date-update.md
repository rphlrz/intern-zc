### **Maintenance Report – October 15, 2025**

During this maintenance cycle, I continued replicating the implementation of the registration date field across the service layers of different equipment modules. The goal was to ensure that each equipment record had a valid registration date (`RegistrationDate`) upon insertion, allowing the dashboard queries to produce consistent results, especially when handling retrospective periods.

Initially, I refactored the method previously named `GetEquipmentByShelterId` to a more generic `GetEquipment`, adjusting its usage within both the service and repository layers. The final implementation looked as follows:

```csharp
// ShelterService
entity.Equipment = repository.GetEquipment(entity.Id);

// ShelterRepository
public Domain.Equipment.Entities.Equipment GetEquipment(int shelterId);

// IShelterRepository
Equipment.Entities.Equipment GetEquipment(int shelterId);
```

Following this, I extended the same logic to other modules such as `Hydrant` and `Hose`, updating their respective service, repository, and interface definitions.

To ensure that every new equipment entry automatically received a registration date, I inserted the following line immediately after the update call within each service’s `Insert` method:

```csharp
entity.Equipment.RegistrationDate = DateTime.Now;
```

This change was implemented in the services of six major equipment types: Extinguisher, Hose, Button, Emergency Kit, Hydrant, and Shelter. The update was placed outside the base constructor (`BaseEquipment`) to avoid unintended side effects, as the constructor creates a new `Equipment` object that could interfere with existing logic.

After verifying all 32 equipment services, I performed tests to confirm that the registration date was correctly stored in the `Equipment` table.

Later, I developed SQL migration scripts to populate the new `RegistrationDate` column for existing records. For equipment with missing registration dates, the logic was as follows:

* Use the original registration date from the specific equipment table (if available);
* Otherwise, use the date of the first inspection;
* If neither was available, default to the current date (`GETDATE()`).

Two different SQL migration approaches were tested. The first used a Common Table Expression (CTE) to join all equipment tables and inspection data in a single query. However, due to inconsistent join results, I implemented a more stable version that used a temporary table (`#FirstInspection`) and executed independent `UPDATE` statements for each equipment type. Below is an illustrative example of one of these updates:

```sql
-- Example: Shelter equipment update
UPDATE e
SET e.RegistrationDate = COALESCE(s.RegistrationDate_Shelter, i.FirstInspectionDate, GETDATE()),
    e.LastSyncDate = GETDATE()
FROM Equipment e
LEFT JOIN Shelter s ON e.Id = s.EquipmentId
LEFT JOIN #FirstInspection i ON e.Id = i.EquipmentId
WHERE e.EquipmentType = 'SHEL' AND e.RegistrationDate IS NULL;
```

Afterward, I validated the results with analytical queries to check the registration date distribution and the number of inspections per equipment type. These checks ensured that all active and historical records had coherent registration dates aligned with their operational timelines.

Finally, I prepared the environment for integrating the updated registration date logic into the mobile synchronization process, which would allow both corporate and mobile systems to maintain consistent equipment registration data.
