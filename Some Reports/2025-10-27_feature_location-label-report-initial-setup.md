### Feature Report – October 27, 2025

I began work on a new "Location Label Report" feature. I used the existing "Equipment Label Report" as a template for the new Controller and View. My main goal was to refactor the UI and client-side logic. I simplified the filter section, removing several equipment-specific fields (like "Serial Number" and "OS Number") and adding a new "Location Code" filter. I also removed a JavaScript function that dynamically showed or hid fields based on the selected equipment type, as it was no longer needed. Finally, I streamlined the "Print" button's logic. The old report used a complex switch to call different .aspx pages for each equipment type. I replaced this with a single, direct call to a new rpt_LocationLabel.aspx report and updated the "Select All" JavaScript function to pass the new, simplified filter parameters.
