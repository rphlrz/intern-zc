### Feature Report – October 28, 2025

I continued by adapting the _List.cshtml partial view, which contains the main data grid. I switched the @model from the old EquipmentLabelReportDTO to the new LocationLabelReportDTO. This required me to rebuild the table structure. I removed the old "Serial Number" and "Local Description" columns and added new ones: "Code," "Description," "Equipment Type," "Company," and "Organizational Unit." This also meant updating the data bindings inside the loop (e.g., item.SerialNumber became item.Code). I also updated the URLs for pagination and the "Select All" button to point to the new LocationLabelReportController. Later in the day, I met with a colleague to align on a new requirement: I need to add a new GUID column to the Location table, which will be used as the unique identifier for the QR code. This will require a database migration to backfill the GUID for all existing locations. I also spent some time helping a colleague with a mobile synchronization error.
