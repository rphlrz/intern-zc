## Pagination Implementation, Parent-Unit Enhancements, and Report Rendering Fixes

I tested URL length limits and confirmed that around 300 identifiers already produced failures. In a cross-functional meeting we discussed client usability: some customers created many organizational units distinguished only by a parent unit. I implemented pagination and added the parent-unit column in the organizational unit listing. I started populating a dropdown with both the unit name and its parent in the same control.

During this day I fixed an invalid operation exception in the label report caused by a missing ParentUnitName property at render time. I added the property to the ViewModel and adjusted the LINQ projection in the controller to fill it via navigation properties. For pagination I changed service and repository signatures to return a paging interface from the shared framework instead of unpaged collections, implemented the Paging object with total count and page size, and updated partial views to use Records and TotalRecords. To stop runtime crashes in the local IIS Express instance I corrected the @model declaration in the Index view so the view receives the paged model.
