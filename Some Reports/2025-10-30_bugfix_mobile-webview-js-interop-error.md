### Bugfix Report – October 30, 2025

I spent the morning troubleshooting a Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException on the mobile app: Could not find 'ScrollHandler.unsetDotnetReference' ('ScrollHandler' was undefined). The root cause was purely environmental. My Android emulator was running a very old WebView (based on Chrome 69), which could not parse modern JavaScript syntax (specifically, private class fields # and static initializers) used in our infinite-scroller.js file. This triggered a SyntaxError on load, which prevented the ScrollHandler object from ever being registered on the window object. The solution was simply to update the Chrome browser via the Play Store on the emulator. This, in turn, updated the underlying "Android System WebView" to a modern engine that could correctly parse the script, resolving the JS Interop failure.
